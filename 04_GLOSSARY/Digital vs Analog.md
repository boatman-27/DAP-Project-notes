Analog refers to technology or signals that are continuous rather than broken down into discrete binary code (ones and zeros). Analog systems (e.g., vinyl records, clocks with hands) directly map, measure, or represent data through physical, continuous, and proportional variations, such as electrical voltage or sound waves.

**Analog** is a continuously changing signal. An **Analog signal** is best represented as a physical wave. In a physical wave, the signal increases and decreases, and from one moment to another there is a gradual change up to or down. An example of an analog device would be a dimmable light. The light can be adjusted to several different intensities and is not just turned on or turned off. 

**Digital** is the on or off type of signal with no levels in between. A **Digital signal** is often referred to as *blocky*, where the signal will go from off to on or vice versa. An example of an digital device is a light switch, when a person enters a room and flips the switch the light turns on. Even if they try to flip the switch slowly, the light might flicker between on and off but it cannot go in between.
