A **Digital Audio Player (DAP)** is a dedicated portable electronic device for storing and playing high-quality digital music files, designed for a superior listening experience compared to smartphones or general media players. DAPs are popular among audiophiles who prioritise sound fidelity.

*Key Features and Advantages*
- **Superior Audio Components**: DAPs use high-end internal components, such as specialized [[03 - Projects/Digital Audio Player (DAP)/04_GLOSSARY/Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs)]] and powerful amplifiers, which process audio signals with greater precision, resulting in better clarity, dynamics, and a wider soundstage.
- **High-Resolution Audio Support**: They support lossless and high-resolution audio formats like FLAC, WAV, ALAC, and DSD, which maintain the full detail of the original recording, unlike the compressed formats typically used by standard streaming services or phones.
- **Expandable Storage**: To accommodate the large file sizes of high-resolution tracks, most DAPs feature microSD card slots, allowing for terabytes of expandable storage.
- **Dedicated Functionality**: DAPs are purpose-built solely for music playback, which results in a distraction-free listening experience (no incoming calls, texts, or app notifications) and longer battery life for music playback.
- **Physical Controls**: Many models incorporate physical buttons for playback control (play/pause, skip tracks) that can be operated by feel, without needing to look at the screen.
