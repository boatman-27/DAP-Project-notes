**CMOS** and **RTC** (Real-Time Clock) are closely related components that work together on a computer motherboard. 

- **RTC (Real-Time Clock):** A battery-powered, crystal-controlled oscillator that keeps track of the current date and time when the computer is turned off.
- **CMOS Memory (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor):** A tiny amount of low-power static RAM that stores BIOS settings (e.g., boot order, hardware configuration).

In summary: **The RTC is the clock, and the CMOS is the memory, but they reside on the same chip and share the same battery.**
