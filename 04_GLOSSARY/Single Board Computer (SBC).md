A **Single Board Computer (SBC)** is a complete, functional computer built onto a single circuit board, integrating the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), input/output (I/O) ports, and networking onto one compact board, acting as a small, affordable, and versatile platform for embedded systems, Internet-of-things (IoT), robotics and home automation projects. 

## Key Components & features
- **Processor & Memory:** Built-in CPU and RAM (often soldered).
- **Connectivity:** Includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB ports, and displays (HDMI, etc.).
- **I/O & Expansion:** Often features [[GPIO]] pins, and sometimes PCIe slots for more powerful expansion.
- **Compact Size:** Smaller than traditional desktop motherboards, ideal for space-constrained projects.
## Common Uses
- **IoT Devices:** Prototyping smart home gadgets, sensors.
- **Robotics:** Controlling robot movements and functions.
- **Media Centers:** Building low-power media servers or streaming devices.
- **Industrial Automation:** Custom control systems.
- **Education:** Learning programming and electronics.
