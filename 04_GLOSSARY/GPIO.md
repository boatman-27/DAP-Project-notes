**General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)** pins are uncommitted, software-controllable digital signal pins on microcontrollers and circuit boards (like Raspberry Pi) that can function as either inputs or outputs. They allow processors to interact with external components, reading sensor data (input) or driving devices like LEDs and motors (output).
## Key Aspects of GPIOs:
- **Functionality:** Pins can be configured as input (reading HIGH/LOW voltage) or output (driving voltage).
- **Flexibility:** Each pin is generally configurable by software to suit specific project needs.
- **Features:** Often include internal pull-up/pull-down resistors, interrupt capabilities for edge detection, and drive strength configuration.
- **Usage:** Commonly used in IoT, robotics, and embedded systems to interface with sensors, actuators, and buttons.
