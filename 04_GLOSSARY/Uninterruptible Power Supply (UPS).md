An **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** is a device that provides instant, short-term backup power to electronics during outages, protecting against data loss and hardware damage by bridging the gap until a generator starts or systems can shut down safely. 

It uses stored energy (usually batteries) to deliver stable power, also filtering out voltage spikes. 

## How it works
1. **Normal operation**: The UPS draws power from the wall, charges its internal battery, and provides clean power to connected devices.
2. **Power failure**: When grid power fails, the UPS instantly switches to its battery, supplying power without interruption.
3. **Power restoration**: Once main power returns, the UPS switches back and begins recharging the battery.
Types of UPS Systems

- **Standby/Offline**: Basic backup; switches to battery when power fails.
- **Line-Interactive**: Adds automatic voltage regulation (AVR) for minor fluctuations.
- **Online Double-Conversion**: Most advanced; constantly runs devices from the battery/inverter for continuous, perfect power, ideal for sensitive equipment.
