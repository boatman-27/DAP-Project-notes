# DAP Project Index
## What this is
A personal, end-to-end build of a Digital Audio Player.  
Purpose-built hardware and software, documented honestly, including mistakes.

This project optimizes for:
- Control over the full stack
- Audio reliability over feature count
- Learnings that survive first contact with reality

This is **not**:
- A commercial product (unless some miracle changes my mind)
- An Android skin experiment
- A spec-sheet flex exercise
---
## Current Status 
**Phase:** Concept -> Architecture
**Latest revision:** Pre-Rev A
**Confidence level:** in the mud ngl

**Active blockers:**
- SoC shortlist not finalized
- Power architecture still under debate
- OS direction not locked
---
## Hard Constraints
- Battery life must survive real gain levels
- Device must be operable by one-hand
- Local playback first, streaming optional (don't really care about it, considering its just my FLACs)
- Firmware must be maintainable by one person
